## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r, echo = T}
penguins <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heike/summerschool-2021/main/01-Introduction-to-R/data/penguins.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

head(penguins)

summary(penguins)

install.packages("ggplot2")
library (ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm)) + geom_point()

cor(penguins$bill_length_mm, penguins$flipper_length_mm, use = "pairwise")
```
